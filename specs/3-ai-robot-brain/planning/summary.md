# AI-Robot Brain Module Implementation Summary

## Completed Planning Artifacts

1. **Implementation Plan** (`specs/3-ai-robot-brain/planning/impl-plan.md`)
   - Technical context and architecture overview
   - Constitution compliance check
   - Phased implementation approach
   - Risk analysis and mitigation

2. **Research Document** (`specs/3-ai-robot-brain/planning/research/research.md`)
   - NVIDIA Isaac Sim concepts
   - Isaac ROS capabilities
   - Nav2 navigation systems
   - AI-Robot Brain fundamentals

3. **Data Model** (`specs/3-ai-robot-brain/planning/data-model/data-model.md`)
   - Key entities definition
   - Content structure model
   - Validation rules based on requirements

4. **Quickstart Guide** (`specs/3-ai-robot-brain/planning/quickstart.md`)
   - Development workflow
   - Content creation guidelines
   - Review checklist

5. **Content Structure Contract** (`specs/3-ai-robot-brain/planning/contracts/content-structure.yaml`)

   - Content requirements

## Next Steps

The implementation plan is complete and ready for the task generation phase. The plan covers:

- Creating the Docusaurus module structure for the AI-Robot Brain content
- Developing four chapters as specified in the original requirements
- Ensuring all content meets educational objectives without hardware-specific implementation details
- Following Docusaurus standards and maintaining technical accuracy

The plan aligns with the project constitution and addresses all requirements from the feature specification.
