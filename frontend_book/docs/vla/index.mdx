# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module, where we explore the integration of visual perception, natural language processing, and robotic action to create intelligent, responsive humanoid robots.

## What is VLA?

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) represents a paradigm where visual perception, language understanding, and robotic action are seamlessly integrated. This integration enables robots to understand and respond to human commands in natural language while perceiving and interacting with their environment in real-time.

## Module Structure
