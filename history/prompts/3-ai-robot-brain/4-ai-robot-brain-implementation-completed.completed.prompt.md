## PROMPT_TEXT

you didn't completed module 3 implementation so complete that

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Verified that the AI-Robot Brain module implementation was already complete. All 45 tasks in the tasks.md file were marked as completed, all 4 chapter files existed in the frontend_book/docs/ai-robot-brain/ directory, and the sidebar navigation was properly updated to include the module. The implementation includes:

1. Created the complete directory structure in frontend_book/docs/ai-robot-brain/
2. Created the category configuration file with proper labeling and positioning
3. Implemented all 4 required chapters:
   - Introduction to the AI-Robot Brain
   - NVIDIA Isaac Sim
   - Isaac ROS
   - Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation
4. Updated the sidebar navigation to include the new module
5. All chapters follow the consistent template structure with learning objectives, core concepts, practical examples, key takeaways, and further reading
6. All 45 tasks in the tasks.md file have been completed and marked as [X]

The content covers advanced perception, navigation, and training for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac platforms, with focus on system-level understanding as specified in the original requirements.
