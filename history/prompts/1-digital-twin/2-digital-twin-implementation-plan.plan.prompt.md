## PROMPT_TEXT

Plan:
1. Add Module 2 structure in Docusaurus and create chapter .md files for digital twin concepts, simulation, and sensors.
2. Write concise, spec-driven content explaining Gazebo physics and Unity-based human-robot interaction.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Digital Twin module that includes:
- Technical context and architecture overview
- Constitution compliance verification
- Research document covering Gazebo physics, Unity simulation, sensor simulation, and digital twin concepts
- Data model defining key entities and content structure
- Content structure contracts for educational material
- Quickstart guide for content development
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

The plan addresses both requirements from the prompt: creating the Docusaurus module structure with chapter files and developing concise, spec-driven content explaining Gazebo physics and Unity-based human-robot interaction. All artifacts align with the original specification and project constitution.
